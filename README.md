# Structured-data-classification-with-FeatureSpace

### Introduction
This project demonstrates a streamlined workflow for structured data classification using Keras's FeatureSpace utility. We showcase the simplicity and efficiency of delegating feature preprocessing and encoding to FeatureSpace, leveraging its capabilities to index, preprocess, and encode numerical, integer categorical, and string categorical features.

### Dataset: Cleveland Clinic Foundation Heart Disease
Our dataset, provided by the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, contains 303 rows of patient data, with each row representing a sample and each column describing a patient attribute (feature). The task is binary classification: predicting whether a patient has heart disease based on their features.

### Project Objectives:
* Demonstrate structured data classification using FeatureSpace.  
* Showcase simplified feature preprocessing and encoding.  
* Achieve accurate heart disease prediction using a binary classification model.

### Key Features:
* __Dataset__: Cleveland Clinic Foundation Heart Disease CSV file (303 rows).  
* __Features__: Numerical, integer categorical, and string categorical.  
* __Utility__: Keras FeatureSpace for feature indexing, preprocessing, and encoding. 
* __Task__: Binary classification (heart disease prediction).

### Conclusion:
Our structured data classification model, utilizing Keras's FeatureSpace utility, successfully predicted the likelihood of heart disease for the given patient. With a probability of 43.13%, this patient is considered to be at moderate risk.
